## Overview
This project aims to train a ResNet model that achieves over 90% accuracy with fewer than 5 million trainable parameters. We explored various fine-tuning techniques from both the model architecture and training process to achieve this goal. Specifically, we sought an optimal combination of parameter-related hyperparameters and a suitable model architecture to enhance performance. During training, we applied techniques such as the AdamW optimizer, data augmentation, cosine annealing, and warm-up training to further improve the modelâ€™s performance. For evaluation, we used our model to perform the classification task on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
